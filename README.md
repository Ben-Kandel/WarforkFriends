# WarforkFriends
See which of your friends are currently playing Warfork!

Scrapes www.livesow.net/livefork for player data. The resulting list is written to the console, ignoring servers with 0 human players.
Player count vs. bot count are kept track of, and the list will contain the numbers of both.

Keep a list of friends in the friends.csv file! Supports multiple aliases for your friends, in case they are playing under a different name. Your friends are automatically
searched for when the program runs.

Simply run main.py and look at the console output. If you want to make changes, feel free to. Run tests.py to make sure you don't break any existing code.
